## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (GraphQL API)

- **Framework**: Apollo Server Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Language**: TypeScript

#### Key Services

1. **DevsocApi Service** (`apps/server/src/services/devsocApi.ts`)
   - Fetches course schedules from DevSoc GraphQL API
   - Syncs timetable data to database
   - Handles room availability lookups

2. **Availability Service** (`apps/server/src/services/availability.ts`)
   - Implements interval merging algorithm
   - Finds common free time across multiple users
   - Ranks free slots based on preferences
   - Generates availability blocks for caching

3. **GraphQL Resolvers** (`apps/server/src/index.ts`)
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations
   - Complex queries with relationships
   - Business logic for friend requests, assessments, group events

### Database Schema

#### Core Models
- `User`: User accounts with authentication
- `Course`: University courses
- `UserCourse`: Many-to-many relationship between users and courses
- `Event`: Calendar events (classes, custom, assessments, study, social)
- `Friendship`: Friend relationships with status tracking
- `Assessment`: Course assessments with due dates
- `GroupEvent`: Multi-user events
- `GroupEventParticipant`: Participant tracking for group events
- `OptimizerPreference`: User preferences for schedule optimization
- `AvailabilityBlock`: Cached availability data

## üîó DevSoc API Integration

SyncUp integrates with the DevSoc GraphQL API to fetch UNSW course and room data:

- **Endpoint**: `https://graphql.csesoc.app/v1/graphql`
- **Data Available**:
  - Course schedules and class times
  - Building and room information
  - Room bookings and availability

### Example DevSoc API Query

```graphql
query GetCourseClasses($courseCode: String!, $term: String!) {
  classes(where: { 
    course: { code: { _eq: $courseCode } }
    term: { _eq: $term }
  }) {
    id
    course {
      code
      name
    }
    type
    day
    start_time
    end_time
    location
  }
}
```

## üìä Availability Detection Algorithm

The core algorithm for finding common free time:

1. **Merge all busy slots** from all users
2. **Sort intervals** by start time
3. **Merge overlapping intervals** using sweep line algorithm
4. **Find gaps** between merged intervals
5. **Filter by minimum duration**
6. **Rank slots** based on preferences (time of day, day of week, etc.)

### Complexity
- Time: O(n log n) where n is the total number of events
- Space: O(n) for storing merged intervals

## üé® Frontend (To Be Implemented)

The frontend will include:

1. **Calendar View** - Interactive calendar with event display
2. **Availability Finder** - Select friends and find common free time
3. **Course Manager** - Enroll in courses and sync timetables
4. **Friend System** - Send/accept friend requests
5. **Assessment Tracker** - Track upcoming assessments and deadlines
6. **Group Events** - Create and manage group study sessions

## üîß Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/devsoc_hackathon?schema=public"

# DevSoc API
DEVSOC_API_URL="https://graphql.csesoc.app/v1/graphql"

# Server
PORT=4000
```

## üìù Development

### Adding New Features

1. Update Prisma schema in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --schema=./packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`
3. Generate client: `npx prisma generate --schema=./packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`
4. Add resolvers to `apps/server/src/index.ts`
5. Update frontend components

### Testing GraphQL API

Use the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:4000/graphql` to:
- Explore the schema
- Test queries and mutations
- View documentation
- Debug responses
